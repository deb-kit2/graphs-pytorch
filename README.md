# graphs-pytorch
An implementation of basic graph layers in pytorch.

### `vanillaGCN.py`
A simplified Graph Convolutional Layer.

### `paperGCN.py`
The Graph Convolutional Layer, as in the paper [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907).

### `multiHeadGraphAttention.py`
A working and easy to understand implementation of multi-headed Graph Attention Layer.
